Jolly ‚Äî A Liquid Prompt Theme
=================================

Jolly is a theme for [Liquid Prompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt).

It is an original prompt design, very carefully designed,
that will completely changes the way you imagine the prompt.

It is focused on *improving the user experience*,
by vastly improving the ability of the user to immediately spot
what she should do following her system's state changes.

Has such, you may find it a little bit disconcerting at first.
But we believe that the advantages of this design makes it worth the effort.

Preview
-------

Using the (recommended) "chevron" preset:

The Jolly theme also comes as several variants, changing the shape of the segments separators,
like the "slant" variant:

Design
------

### Rationale

The Jolly theme use a couple of design principles:

* It is accessible to colorblind people, hence it uses:
    * only four colors: dark grey, white, blue and yellow (different color pairs are available as presets for people having blue-yellow colorblindess).
    * At least a text item for each segment,
    * or a blank space between segments.
* The blue colors means that the user is probably expected to perform some task.
* The yellow color carries an error or something of concern.
* Segments for "default" state are joined with graphical symbols that reads from right to left,
  in a way that makes sense.
* It uses three ways to carry information about the state of the system:
    * Important states are denoted by text.
    * Ancillary states can be shown with a single character/icon.
    * States appearing from a user action can be shown by "detaching" two segments usually joined.
      By default, this added space is shown as having a right-to-left direction.

The prompt itself is designed in three lines:

- The first line shows the state of the shell itself (type of graphical server, remote connection, user, host, path, etc.) on the left,
  and optional sensors states on the right (temperature, jobs, time, etc.).
- The second line displays whatever keywords have a meaning in the context (virtual environments, software collections, etc.).
- The third line indicates the relationships toward extern services (internet, VCS) and immediate status (runtime, error code).
  This is also where the actual prompt is.


### Example

For instance, in the following prompt, you can see that the user is in a Git repository and has some action waiting to be done:
- the rightmost blue "‚â†" indicates that there are some modifications waiting to be committed (hence the directional hint, from a diff to the branch).
- the leftmost blue segment indicates that there are some commits that may be pushed to the remote (hence the directional hint, from the branch to the VCS symbol).

The screenshot also shows that the last command ended in an error, hence the red-over-yellow error code.

The upper section shows a classical state of the prompt: a shell within a graphical server ("X"),
for the default login user ("Ôêï", a figure), on localhost ("ÓÄÜ", an island), in the liquidprompt directory, which is underlined because it is also a VCS repository.


### Full description

The following diagram shows almost all the possible states of a Jolly Liquid Prompt

![](liquidprompt_jolly_design.png)

The diagram is available [in a vector format](liquidprompt_jolly_design.svg) (note: you need a browser/viewer configured to use a [nerd-font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to see it correctly).



Setup
-----

To actually use the Jolly theme, you need to add a few configuration commands to the script that loads Liquid Prompt.
For example:

```sh

   # Load Liquid Prompt.
   source ~/liquidprompt/liquidprompt
   # Configure the desired variant (or colors, etc.).
   source ~/lp-jolly/presets/variant-chevron.conf
   # Load the theme.
   source ~/lp-jolly/jolly.theme && lp_theme jolly
```

NOTE: The recommended segment markers (the "chevron" variant) uses characters in the private section of Unicode
that are defined by the "Nerd-fonts" project.
You will either need a compatible font, or use a variant that does not need them, like "text" and "jolly".

See the [Nerd-fonts Fonts installation docs](https://www.nerdfonts.com) for help on installing this kind of fonts.


Presets
--------

The `presets` directory contains configurations changing several variables at once.
It contains configuration files for changing the color pair (e.g. green/red instead of blue/yellow)
and the segments shape (see below).

### Variants

Variants needing a Nerd-fonts font:

- "chevron" (the recommended one):

![](screenshots/varint-chevron.png)

- "round":

![](screenshots/variant-round.png)

- "slant":

![](screenshots/variant-slant.png)

Variants available with a regular font:

- "jolly" (the default):

- "text" (using only common characters):

Configuration
-------------

### Liquid Prompt Configuration

The Jolly theme honors Liquid Prompt configuration options,
except for the ones defining colors, specific marks and disabling some features.

The following options are honored:

- [`LP_ENABLE_PERM`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_ENABLE_PERM),
- [`LP_MARK_BATTERY`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_MARK_BATTERY),
- [`LP_MARK_LOAD`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_MARK_LOAD),
- [`LP_MARK_TEMP`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_MARK_TEMP),
- [`LP_PS1_PREFIX`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_PS1_PREFIX).

The following options are **not honored**:

- every ``LP_COLOR_\*`` options.
- all the others ``LP_MARK_\*`` options not listed in the above section.
- [`LP_USER_ALWAYS`](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#LP_USER_ALWAYS) (at least a user icon is always displayed).


### Theme Configuration

#### Presets

Some example configurations are provided in the `/presets/` directory.

Note: the order in which you load the presets may be important.
When changing the colors of the first line, presets needs to be loaded
from your shell configuration and not just sourced in the prompt.

A first set is called "variants" and mainly change the segment joints,
but can also impact the icons on some variants:

- `source presets/variant-chevron.conf` (the *recommended*, need a Nerd-fonts font),
- `source presets/variant-slant.conf` (need a Nerd-fonts font),
- `source presets/variant-round.conf` (need a Nerd-fonts font),
- `source presets/variant-text.conf` (the one that works anywhere).

A second set changes the colors:

- `source presets/colors_green-red.conf` (warning in red, notes in green),
- `source presets/colors_cyan-magenta.conf` (warning in magenta, notes in cyan),
- `source presets/colors_high-contrast.conf` (segments are very white and very black instead of slightly grayish),

interpolated from `JOLLY_COLOR_LINE_START`
to `JOLLY_COLOR_LINE_END`.


**JOLLY_MARK_ERROR** *string = "ÔÅó "*

#### Variant Markers

These options are the one used to actually define the theme variants.
You may overcome them with your own configuration.

**JOLLY_ITEMS** *array<string> = ("‚î´" "‚îÉ" "‚î£")*

Characters used to separate keywords in the middle line.
The middle character separates keywords of the same type (e.g. every Software Collection).


#### Spacing

You may overcome the spacing details with these options.

**JOLLY_SPACE_VOID** *string = " "*

Spacing character around segments joints marker.


**JOLLY_SPACE_PATH** *string = " "*

Spacing character specifically for the "current path" section.


**JOLLY_SPACE_FIELD** *string = ""*

Spacing character around the content of the segments themselves.


**JOLLY_SPACE_LINE** *string = " "*

Spacing character around the keywords of the middle line.


**JOLLY_SPACE_FILL** *string = "‚ñà"*

it is recommended to stick to aligned ANSI values (i.e. greys)


**JOLLY_COLOR_LINE_END** *array<int> = (232 -1 1 0 15 -1)*

The color ending the gradient of the line of the middle section.
Default is black.
